This program dynamically creates a multiplication table based on the form input.
The values must be between -999 and 999 and no farther apart than a 100.
Also the minimum must be lower than the maximum.
This is really just so that the program doesn't end up running for way too long.
It checks that this is the case using the jQuery validation plugin.
